# Quadcopter Simulation Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The `simulation.py` file has been refactored from a monolithic class (642 lines) into a clean entry point that orchestrates multiple specialized subsystems.

## New Architecture

### Core Modules (`core/`)
- **`physics.py`** - `PhysicsEngine` class handles all physics calculations, state updates, and ground interactions
- **`state_manager.py`** - `StateManager` class manages drone state, trajectory, and mode tracking
- **`flight_controller.py`** - `FlightController` class handles control logic for different flight modes (manual, auto, takeoff, etc.)
- **`safety_system.py`** - `SafetySystem` class manages crash detection, recovery, and emergency procedures

### Utility Modules (`utils/`)
- **`helpers.py`** - Common utility functions like rotor positioning, camera simulation, and mathematical helpers

### Main Entry Point
- **`simulation.py`** - Clean interface that orchestrates all subsystems (~150 lines vs original 642 lines)

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Much easier to modify specific functionality without affecting other systems
3. **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Readability**: Code is organized logically and easier to understand
5. **Reusability**: Core components can be reused in other projects
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Public API remains unchanged for existing code

## Key Features Preserved

- All original functionality maintained
- Same public interface for external usage
- All flight modes (manual, auto, takeoff, landing, hover)
- Physics simulation with ground collision
- Safety systems and recovery modes
- Debug and visualization features

## Usage
The refactored simulation maintains the same interface:

```python
from quadcopter_sim.simulation import QuadcopterSimulation

sim = QuadcopterSimulation()
sim.step(delta_time)
sim.takeoff(3.0)
sim.hover()
# ... all existing methods work the same
```

## Files Created
- `core/physics.py`
- `core/state_manager.py` 
- `core/flight_controller.py`
- `core/safety_system.py`
- `core/__init__.py`
- `utils/helpers.py`
- `utils/__init__.py`

## Original File
- `simulation.py` - Refactored to clean entry point
